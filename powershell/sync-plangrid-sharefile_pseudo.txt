PlanGrid Cloud storage sync

assume the new dir structure is implemented for the project
1. check PlanGrid folder for new files (i.e. date >= today)
2. For each new file, search Sharefile to make sure the file does not already exist
	-If the file already exists but has an earlier date then compare the two files or prompt user to check manually
3. copy new files and upload to same directory in OneDrive if all requirements are met
